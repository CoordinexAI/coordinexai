# CoordinexAI

CoordinexAI is an AI-first coordination assistant designed to reduce the **friction constant**—the invisible tax on team momentum caused by unspoken delays, unclear requests, and dropped handoffs.

## 🔍 What is the Friction Constant?

The friction constant is a conceptual framework representing the micro-resistances that slow down work execution. These include:
- Delays in response time
- Context switching
- Vague or ambiguous requests
- Hesitation to follow up
- Misalignment across tools or teams

## 🚀 MVP Scope

CoordinexAI’s MVP is focused on three core capabilities:
1. **Friction Detection** – Analyze Slack, Notion, or Calendar data to find points of delay or breakdown.
2. **Friction Score** – Assign a score to projects or conversations based on delay, repetition, silence, and mismatch.
3. **AI Nudging** – Suggest timely interventions: follow-ups, clarification prompts, or coordination summaries.

## 🧠 Tech Stack (proposed)

- GPT-4o or Claude for NLP
- LangChain for agent memory/context
- Slack API, Notion API, Google Calendar API
- Streamlit or Retool for friction analytics dashboard
