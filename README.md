# 🌀 CoordinexAI

> Detect the friction before it becomes failure.

**The Friction Constant** is the silent drag that slows down teams:  
missed handoffs, delays, vague tasks, and “just checking in” loops.

**CoordinexAI** detects that drag before it snowballs—giving you the nudges and insights you didn’t know you needed.
